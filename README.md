# Welcome To MailMan

## MailMan is a Web Application Built on Ruby On Rails

I started this project during my time at General Assembly WDI course Fall 13

My Goal was to create a application that allows small businesses to manage there email marketing.

I wanted to make an app that was geared towards serving the small business community and allowing them to pool their resources, so that they can effectively send more emails and internet resoucres. Which will grow their marketing efforts with less overhead, and allow them as a community to grow more rapidly.

It was a very ambitious project to tackle with only a week to deadline to implement. But within this week thanks to some really amazing frameworks i was able to leverage their power to implement a foundation for what i want this project to eventually become.
